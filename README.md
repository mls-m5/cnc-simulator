# nc-sim

Remember to set open cascade dir to something like

```bash
cmake  -DOpenCASCADE_DIR=/usr/local/lib/cmake/ [other options]
```

## Make and install OpenCASCADE from source

Just do it...

## To do before starting

Place some step file that contains your cnc-machine into the `data` directory.
The program will just pick whatever step file is there.
